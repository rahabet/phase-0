<!-- Add your reflection here -->

<!--
1)What did you learn about the DOM?

    Its interesting seeing things in action and able to manipulate them and I also realized that there is more into it.

2)What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

    I think the most common one we used for this exercise is accessing elements by thier Id and also by the tag name to add or change thier value.
