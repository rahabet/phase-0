#Pseudocode

  #Input : list of names
  #Output: a small group of people from the names
  #Steps :
    # create a container to hold all the names
    # slice the names into a group of 5 people
    # print out the names in the new group

#Initial Solution

 def accountability_groups(seaLions)
  new_groups = seaLions.each_slice(5).to_a
  new_groups.each_with_index do |name,index|
      puts "#{name.join(",")} => are group: #{index}"
    end

#Refactor

#Reflection

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
   # it is interesting to try to create a new group from a list of all that names but at the same time challenging how to make it automatically create the groups.
# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
   # I still am struggling with psedocode. my pseudocode was not that much helpful i think i need more practice.
# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
  # I have no idea how could have I made it any better so i leave it this way for now
# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
 # I used arrays and i thought it is easier for this case. I somehow start thinking may be if i create a hash and push the value and make the index as a key that might have saved me some time trying to figure out how to create the group number along hmmm. anyway I used arrays.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

 # This is the initial solution which seems like refactored already.
