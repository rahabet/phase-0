**What does puts do?**

  puts simply writes onto the screen whatever comes after it.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

  Integers are numbers without decimal points and Floats are numbers with decimal numbers. Floats are mainly used for academic purposes.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

  when you do integer division, you will get integer answers. it divides the numbers to the value they can and leave the remainder. for example 7/2 = 3 it always rounds the number down and puts it as an answer. where as floats gives the answer including the rounding part 7/2 = 3.5 .


*Hours in a year*

  puts  24 * 365

*minutes in a decade*

  puts 60 * 24
  puts  1440 * 365
  puts  525600 * 10

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

  ruby  handles arithmetic problems like the same as any other systems like calculator.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

  strings are a group of words, phrases or  letters in a program. we use them when we want to print out some words in our program. strings need to be wrapped in ‘ string ’ to show that they are strings.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

  a variable is a word or a name that grasps a single value. variables allow as to easily reference objects in ruby. we use them when we want to store a string or a number to our computers memory for the later use.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

  It was kind of a reminder for what I did read a while back and its good. the concepts were not challenging at all.
