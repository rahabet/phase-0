    <p>Version control keeps track of all your progress and also allows multiple people to work on the same script with out stepping on each others toes. If you break something version control can take you bake and time travel in your script to when it was all okay. When you work with people you can use version control to help be like "This one is mine i'm gonna work on it. And that, thats yours you work on it" and when your both done you can tell git while you sit in front of your lap top. "Git i command you now make these two a one!" and gits all like 'i is not a git command see some help'. 'git merge [bookmark]/[branch]' is the right one all joking aside. GitHub now knows who you are and when your working with a team your commits pulls merges etc. they are all tracked. Don't understand a new piece of code or who did it? GitHub does! Need some help with a thing? Not only do you have the GitHub community where someone has probably worked on the same problem as you but you also have your team to chat with on GitHub and members of the community who like deep shades of green on their contributions map. </p>
    <p> Github is a social coding website that allows developer to share their code and keep track of changes using git. Github is a platform to push on the changes you made locally in your computer using git to a remote repository in Github. Everyone who is working on the same project able to see the changes you made using Github and also you are able to merge your files together to a common final repository.</p>

<!--
• What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  for this exercise, the HTML5 tags we used  are : <main>, <header>,<nav> <article> and <footer> because they are like the driving elements for html. we kept returning to <article> tag because we were adding paragraphs to it.

  • How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  elements are laid out on a page in the order they appear in the html tags. while css can style where specifically these elements are placed, the browser outlines the content based on the hierarchy of how information appears.

  • What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    I previously didn’t know about the tab use so it was exciting for me to see the  basic codes happening when I press tab. and also the use of the snippets it’s something nice to have. make the skeleton design of the page and save it for re-using purposes. I will definitely browse more to figure out other shortcuts so that am able to use them when ever necessary.
