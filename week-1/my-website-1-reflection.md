#My reflections on "your website"
  • Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

     rahabet.gitub.io

  • Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

    First you login to your Github account and at the top right corner there is a plus sign. press on that and you see create repository button. You click it, it directs you to a page where you provide name, description… and when you finish editing, click on create repository.

    Cloning a repository is adding a copy of your repository which is in remote to exist locally in your computer.  To do that, use git clone command and past the LINK which you copy from the created (forked) repository .In the command line in your computer write “git clone ‘the link’ “.

  • Describe what open source means.

    Open source means that free the softwares’ source code for everyone to use, edit and  modify it. Anyone can have access to both the out put and the source code so that they can work on it to make it better or customize the code to their own use.

  • What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

    I think open source is a great idea for many reasons.It allows developers to work together for a better cause, it makes you able to customize the code as it fits to your needs, creates access for anyone who can not afford to buy a software and it can be reliable too sometimes.

    I think it makes me protective knowing that a lot of people put their time and effort on making it perfect overtime, fixing bugs, adding new features and more.

  • Assess the importance of using licenses.

     Licenses allow the software to be freely used, modified and distributed with out seeking permission.It allows the creators to have the ownership of their software and grant permission to others to use that work.

  • What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

    I struggled more on the previous chapter 1.5. Got lost at some point and had to start over to understand better and get a working solution. so this time it was easier to get it right

  • Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

    I watched a couple of youtube videos on how git works and understand the commands.
