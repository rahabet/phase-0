#1.1 Think About Time
All the links have a valuable information but the pomodorotechnique is new for me. It is a way of working with time I have got effectively and also taking a scheduled short break in between the code. It seems interesting and I will put it in effect. I understood time boxing as it is all about putting time limits towards completion of some goal or activity. it can be important to manage each weeks schedule during phase 0 by figuring out how much time we have each week and make a proper schedule towards the completion of each weeks project. currently, am not that scheduled. am just trying to use all my free time on the project but I have some difficulties on managing it well. so I am going to try the pomodorotechnique to get the best out of my free time and also develop some tiny habits each day. during phase 0, I like to improve the way how i was using time and ask myself everyday “what would I absolutely love to do and feel immensely proud of doing today? “
#1.2 The Command Line
a shell is simply a text interface for the computer and it takes in commands which it passes on to the computers’ operating system to run. the concept of the video “an introduction to the shell” is challenging for me to grasp since am new for command line interface. the book was useful to simplify and get familiar with the most commonly used commands. I was able to use the commands successfully but have some difficulties on some of them specially when i need to combine them together. I believe its important to know the basic commands first like how to make directories, copy files, move files …
*pwd : print working directory and it outputs the name of the directory that you are currently in
*ls : list directory, it lists all the files and directories in the working directory
*mv : move a file or directory, its moves a file or a directory from the source to the destination files.
*../ : its a command that returns the user to the parent directory
*touch : is a command to create a new file inside the working directory
*mkdir : make directory, it is used to create a directory or a folder
*less : is a command used to print a page through a file. if the file is big it makes it easier for the reader to access.
*rmdir : remove directory. it removes an existing directory from the file system assuming the directory is empty before it is removed.
*rm : remove files and directory trees. it can be dangerous if we don’t know how to use it.
*help: provides help
